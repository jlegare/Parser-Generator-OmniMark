8001 - SIMPLE ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS
====================================

- standard example of direct left-recursion being used to impose operator associativity.

8002 - SIMPLE ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS
====================================

- same as 8001, but with left-recursion removed.

8011 - INDIRECT RECURSION
=========================

- monkeyed-up example with indirect left-recursion.

8012 - INDIRECT RECURSION
=========================

- same as 8011, but with left-recursion removed.

8021 - INDIRECT RECURSION
=========================

- monkeyed-up example with indirect left-recursion, where the recursion is limited to a sub portion of the grammar, and
  where one non-terminal has multiple left-recursions.

8022 - INDIRECT RECURSION
=========================

- same as 8022, but with left-recursion removed.
